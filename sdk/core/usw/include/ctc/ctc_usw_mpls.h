\p
In MPLS, the assignment of a particular packet to a particular FEC is
done just once, as the packet enters the network.  The FEC to which
the packet is assigned is encoded as a short fixed length value known
as a "label".  When a packet is forwarded to its next hop, the label
is sent along with it; that is, the packets are "labeled" before they
are forwarded.
\p
\b
At subsequent hops, there is no further analysis of the packet's
network layer header.  Rather, the label is used as an index into a
table which specifies the next hop, and a new label.  The old label
is replaced with the new label, and the packet is forwarded to its
next hop.

\p
\b
 In The Module, MPLS is treated as a L3 feature, and L3 interface
 should be retrieved before MPLS process stage. The L3 interface and
 router MAC determination is the same as routing process.

\p
\b
Basic Mpls
\pp
  The Module MPLS support the basic packet operation:
\ppp
    \ddd PUSH: When packets enter Mpls network, LER add labels to packets
    \ddd SWAP: LSR replace the outer label with a new label
    \ddd POP: Switch remove the outer label
\ppp
    ctc_mpls_add_ilm()
\p
\b
Differentiated Services
\pp
  The Module MPLS support L-Lsp and E-Lsp and three Differentiated Services
  Modes:
\ppp
    \ddd UNIFORM
    \ddd PIPE
    \ddd SHORT PIPE
\ppp
    ctc_mpls_add_ilm()
\p
\b
L2VPN
\pp
 The Module MPLS support the point-to-point Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS)
 and point-to-multipoint Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Ethernet transport
 services.
\pp
 Use API ctc_mpls_add_l2vpn_pw() to build PW and use ctc_mpls_l2vpn_pw_t.l2vpntype
 to distinguish VPLS and VPWS.
\pp
 The Module MPLS support two AC access methods:
    \ddd Ethernet Access
    \ddd VLAN Access
\pp
 And support two PW encapsulation mode:
\pp
    \ddd RAW Mode
    \ddd Tagged Mode
\pp
 And also support control word decapsulation.
\pp
 Use ctc_mpls_l2vpn_pw_t.pw_mode to distinguish PW encapsulation modes.

\b
\pp
 In VPWS, a VPN consists of two MPLS ports. Packets arriving on one MPLS
 port are sent directly out the other MPLS port. Ethernet frames are mapped
 into a MPLS pseudowire based on incoming port plus packet header information.
 At the end of a pseudowire, forwarding of Ethernet frames after MPLS
 decapsulation is based on the MPLS label lookup.

\b
\pp
 In VPLS, a VPN is similar to a VLAN, which identifies a group of physical
 ports to be included in a broadcast domain. However, instead of physical
 ports, a VPLS VPN identifies a group of ¡°virtual-ports¡± to be included
 in a broadcast domain.  The VPN ID(VSI ID) is used to qualify MAC DA lookups
 in VPLS. Ethernet frames of interest are also identified by incoming port
 plus packet header information. Ethernet frames are switched into one or
 more MPLS pseudowires based on the MAC DA lookup. At the end of a pseudowire,
 frames again are switched based on MAC DA lookup.

\p
\b
L3VPN
\pp
 L3 VPNs are used to identify a virtual routing table. When creating an L3 VPN,
 a VRF must be specified. At the end of a MPLS tunnel, the IPv4 or IPv6 DestIP
 lookup is qualified by VRF associated with the L3 VPN. L3 MPLS deals with the
 establishment of MPLS tunnels. At the MPLS tunnel initiation point, packets
 entering the tunnel are encapsulated with an MPLS header (label PUSH operation).
 IPv4 and IPv6 packets can be directed into an MPLS tunnel based on the DestIP
 lookup. Along the path of the MPLS tunnel, MPLS label SWAP, PUSH, PHP, and POP
 operations are supported. At the end of an MPLS tunnel, forwarding of IPv4 and
 IPv6 packets is based on DestIP lookup.
 Virtual routing tables are supported for the DestIP lookup.
\pp
 L3 VPNs are used to identify a virtual routing table. When creating an L3 VPN,
 a VRF must be specified. At the end of a MPLS tunnel, the IPv4 or IPv6 DestIP
 lookup is qualified by VRF associated with the L3 VPN.
\pp
 Use ctc_mpls_add_ilm() to configure the ilm, and ctc_mpls_ilm_t.flw_vrf_srv_aps.vrf_id
 to attach the VRF
