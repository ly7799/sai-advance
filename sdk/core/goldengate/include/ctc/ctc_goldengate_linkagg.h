 Link Aggregation is a method by which many Ethernet ports can be bundled together to form a linkagg port. The linkagg
 is regarded as one logical link, and is useful when a high bandwidth and/ or redundancy between switches are required.
 All ports in a linkagg must be configured with the same speed and the transmission mode for each linkagg member port
 must be set to full-duplex.

 \b
 \p
 Linkagg  provide features below:
 \d Static Load balance.
 \d Dynamic Load balance.
 \d Round robin Load balance.
 \d Failover.

\b
\p
\B Static Load balance.
\p
 Supports up to 64 link aggregation group and 6 linkagg mode:
\p
 64[G]*16[M], 32[G]*32[M], 16[G]*64[M], 8[G]*128[M], 4[G]*256[M], 8[G]*32[M] + 48[G]*16[M].[G] denotes how many
 linkagg groups, [M] denotes how many linkagg member ports per group.
\p
 Port Selection Criteria (PSC) are used to spread the traffic across the linkagg's member ports by different hash value,
 hash key can be macsa, macda, vlan, ipsa, ipda and others,you can use ctc_linkagg_set_psc() to set port selection criteria.

\b
\p
\B Dynamic Load balance(DLB).
\p
 Dynamic Load Balance(DLB) is used to choose the minimum load of bandwidth among linkagg members as the
 egress. DLB member port selection mechanism is as follows:
 \p
 The traffic status of each member port is monitored in the traffic management module.
 A timer uses a specific discounting algorithm to evaluate each port's output bandwidth.
 At the same time, If some link is down and consider member port's output bandwidth and status,
 the mechanism will elect a least load and active memeber, which will be used to do rebalance.


\b
\p
\B Round robin Load balance(RR)
\p
The traditional hash mechanism will introduce uneven link bandwidth usage because the same flow selects a only link.
If considering the end points can resolve TCP reorder problem,
then per-packet round robin forwarding mechanism has very good bandwidth utilization.
\pp
RR  Load balance support two mode:
\pp
1)Regular mode: This mode distribute each packet to each member from member0 to member2 according to the order.
\pp
2)Random mode: The above regular mode can not consider a flow's packet length variability.
 The mode shows that start point of each round uses random mechanism to select,
 and the following of the round is same with regular mode.

\b
\p
\B Failover
\p
During system running, if one member port of a linkagg goes down,
the traffic will still be hashed into this member port before CPU detects the Link down event
and remove it from the member list.
To reduce the whole process duration, Supports hardware base Failover convergence upon one member down.

 @brief Init the linkagg module

 @param[in]  linkagg_global_cfg linkagg global config information

 @remark  Initialize the linkagg module, including global variable, soft table, asic table, etc.
                This function has to be called before any other linkagg functions.
                LinkAgg group num can set by user according to the parameter linkagg_global_cfg
\p
                group num can be change :
\d              CTC_LINKAGG_MODE_4:  4 groups
\d              CTC_LINKAGG_MODE_8:  8 groups
\d              CTC_LINKAGG_MODE_16: 16 groups
\d              CTC_LINKAGG_MODE_32: 32 groups
\d              CTC_LINKAGG_MODE_64: 64 groups
\d              CTC_LINKAGG_MODE_56: 56 groups

\p
                Supports up to 64 link aggregation group. In one group, member number can be any one of
                1-16, 32, 64, 128 and 256. But totally, the memberNum * groupNum is up to 1024.
                When linkagg_global_cfg is NULL, linkagg will use default global config to initialize sdk.
                Notice: When config CTC_LINKAGG_MODE_64,  dlb is not support in this mode.
                When config CTC_LINKAGG_MODE_56, only group 0-7 can be config as dlb mode and every dlb
                group can only support 32 flow.
                If configure dlb mode, max member number is 16 regardless of group mode configured.
\p
                By default:
                LinkAgg group num is 32 (CTC_LINKAGG_MODE_32).
